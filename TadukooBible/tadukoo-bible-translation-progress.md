This is about how the translation progress is determined for [Tadukoo Bible](/projects/TadukooBible.html).

## New System
This new system was used after Release 1.0 to have a more accurate percent for the calculations.

Every 11.89 chapters is 1%. Since there are 1,189 chapters in the Bible, this would work out to an accurate figure by number of chapters done. Below are the 
percentages each book turns out to be. The books that are listed together are listed that way so that they equal 1% or higher. Each percent was rounded to a 
whole number for easier percentage calculations.

* Genesis = 4%
* Exodus = 3%
* Leviticus = 2%
* Numbers = 3%
* Deuteronomy = 3%
* Joshua = 2%
* Judges and Ruth = 2%
* 1 Samuel = 3%
* 2 Samuel = 2%
* 1 Kings = 2%
* 2 Kings = 2%
* 1 Chronicles = 2%
* 2 Chronicles = 3%
* Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther = 3%
* Job = 4%
* Psalms = 13%
* Proverbs = 3%
* Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs/Solomon = 2%
* Isaiah = 6%

## Old System
This system was used up to Release 1.0. It was replaced by the system above to make the percents more accurate.

Each book of the Bible is either considered 2% (or a part of 2%) of the entirety.

The books which are not two percent by themselves are:
* Judges and Ruth = 2%
* Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther = 2%
* Psalms is divided into five sections:
	* Psalms 1-30 = 2%
	* Psalms 31-60 = 2%
	* Psalms 61-90 = 2%
	* Psalms 91-120 = 2%
	* Psalms 121-150 = 2%
* Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs = 2%
* Jeremiah and Lamentations = 2%
* Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi = 2%
* Titus and Philemon = 2%
* 1 John, 2 John, and 3 John = 2%
* Jude and Revelation = 2%
