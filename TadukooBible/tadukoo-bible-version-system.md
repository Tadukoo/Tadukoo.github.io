category: TadukooBible

This is about how the version numbers are determined for [Tadukoo Bible](/projects/TadukooBible.html).

## After 1.0
After the Official Release, each version will get:
* 0.0.1 added for small updates (e.g. v.1.0.1), which can include:
	* 1 new command
	* 1 - 10 new features to existing commands
	* <25 Bug fixes
	* 1 new book
	* 1 - 5 new permissions
	* 1 - 5 new configuration options
	* <25 other changes
* 0.1 for minor updates (e.g. v.1.1), which can include:
	* A new translation
	* 2 - 9 new commands
	* 11 - 25 new features to existing commands
	* 25 - 99 Bug fixes
	* 2 - 9 new books
	* 6 - 25 new permissions
	* 6 - 15 new configuration options
	* A new language
	* 25 - 99 other changes
* 1 for major updates (e.g. v.2.0), which can include:
	* 10+ new commands
	* 26+ new features to existing commands
	* 100+ Bug fixes
	* 10+ new books
	* 26+ new permissions
	* 17+ new configuration options
	* A new language with its own translation
	* 100+ other changes

Note: Any new translations will probably only be added once they're completed or added in halves, fourths, fifths, or tenths.


## Alpha through 1.0

### Alpha
Alpha is the original version through the time the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy), the Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), and the 3 Johns (1, 2, and 3 John) are completed.

### Beta
Beta will be from the time Alpha is completed (which will be Beta 0.2), until the time that the official release comes. During this time, I will only update the plugin (on the BukkitDev page at least) when either 
10% more is completed or a new feature is added or a bug is fixed.

### Official Release (1.0)
The "official release" will be once the entire Bible is complete in the KJV translation. This will be v.1.0.

### Decimals
During this time, the entire system is based off of just the King James Version progress. The decimals are 0.0.1 per 1% of the Bible that is completed (so 10% is 0.1 and 15% is 0.1.5). The system used at this time 
is the Old System, where most books are 2%.
