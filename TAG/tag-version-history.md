[T.A.D.U.K.O.O. I.S. T.H.E. G.R.E.A.T.E.S.T. P.E.R.S.O.N. W.H.O. E.V.E.R. L.I.V.E.D.](/projects/TAG.html) has been in development for a long time, and it has gone through many 
version system changes along with actual development happening. Below are links to the pages that talk about the various stages of the history in more detail.

## Pre-Alpha

### Old Version System
Old Version System History - Coming Soon

The old version system was used before an actual version system was chosen.

### v.0.0.1.0
v.0.0.1.0 History - Coming Soon

Once the new version system was made, it was decided that v.0.0.1.0 would come when the Bedroom (the first area) was completed.

### v.0.0.2.0
[v.0.0.2.0 History](/changelogs/tag-0020.html)

The goal of v.0.0.2.0 became making the Options and Pause menus, along with fixing various bugs in the game that had arisen and improving certain elements of it.

### v.0.0.3.0
[v.0.0.3.0 History](/changelogs/tag-0030.html)

The goal of v.0.0.3.0 became making the second area of the game (the Hallway) and trying to condense the code with the idea that it would help prevent future problems and help 
to optimize the game.

### v.0.0.4.0
[v.0.0.4.0 History](/changelogs/tag-0040.html)

The goal of v.0.0.4.0 became making a box at the top of the screen to include information for the game (such as dialogue, objectives, possible interactions, etc.)

### v.0.0.5.0
[v.0.0.5.0 History](/changelogs/tag-0050.html)

The goal of v.0.0.5.0 became making a save system to save the current area, part, chapter, and coordinates of the Player, among other information needed to continue where 
you left off.

### v.0.0.6.0
v.0.0.6.0 History - Coming Soon

This is the current stage of the game's development. The goal of v.0.0.6.0 was originally to optimize the game, but eventually it added so many other ideas, including a 
Player Select screen, being able to "hack" objects, having achievements, adding more sounds, making a more useful debug system, improving the save system, making controls 
configurable, adding animations when transitioning between areas, and having the areas generated from map files. Most of the ideas have simply been pushed back to later 
versions, but some have been scrapped. Of the ones listed, the only one scrapped was the areas generated from map files.

Eventually, the goal of v.0.0.6.0 was settled on splitting the game between API, Engine, and Game.
