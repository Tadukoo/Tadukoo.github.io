This page details the updates to [Lucario and Lickilicky's Adventure (Blue Version)](/story/version/lucario-adventure-blue.html).

**Note:** Back when I was working on the story, I treated changes and additional chapters like I was updating a program, using version numbering. 
Fortunately, it was a single number (no minor versions / patch numbers).

* [v.59 (Printed Copy)](#v59-printed-copy)

## v.1
* Unknown Date
* Wrote “Part 1” (now Part 1 Prologue)

## v.2
* Unknown Date
* Wrote “Part 2” (now Chapter 1)

## v.3 - August 20, 2008 11:58 PM
* Put answers to questions in bold
* e.g. “He pointed to a ship ten yards away. {Question 3}”
* The version I have from the above date has an incomplete “Part 2” with no review, so I don’t know if it’s legitimate

## v.4
* Unknown Date
* Answers are no longer in bold (in current format, answered in review of chapter)

## v.5
* Unknown Date
* Wrote “Part 3” (now Chapter 2)

## v.6
* Unknown Date
* Added cover page (not sure if logo was made prior to this or not)

## v.7
* Unknown Date
* Wrote “Part 4” (now Chapter 3)

## v.8
* Unknown Date
* Added “Extra Questions” - questions more directed at myself than what’s coming in the story that I’d answer right away. These were added to the end of “Part 4”s review

## v.9 - November 16, 2008 8:21 PM
* Wrote “Part 5” (now Chapter 4) - the version I have with the date above though is an incomplete “Part 5” with no review, so it may not be 100% legitimate

## v.10
* Unknown Date
* Wrote “Part 6” (now Chapter 5)

## v.11
* Unknown Date
* Wrote “Part 7” (now Part 1 Epilogue)

## v.12
* Unknown Date
* Edited “Part 1” (now Part 1 Prologue)
* “Edited” includes moving “Lucario said”, “Lickilicky replied”, etc. to after their dialogue (used to be before their dialogue with a comma)
* Changed “Lucario dialed Blissey’s number. [242.] It rang 3 times.” to “Lucario dialed Blissey’s number [242]. Her phone rang 3 times.”
* Put Lickilicky’s talking fast to Blissey in proper punctuation and capitalization to match his fast talking to Lucario.
* Put the mark above the e in pokémon
* Changed them crashing “on Earth” to crashing “on a planet” so the reader wouldn’t know until “Part 2” (Chapter 1)

## v.13
* Unknown Date
* Edited “Part 2” (now Chapter 1)
* Changed from Earth to a planet until “Part 3” (Chapter 2) where the characters figure out it’s Earth
* Changed from Lucario’s ship exploding into 10 parts right away to exploding into 9 right away, then the 10th later for comedy
* Based on the v.9 I have, those changes were made earlier than this version, but I’m not sure (since each version I have may not be 100% authentic since I didn’t keep them consistently)

## v.14
* Unknown Date
* Space between paragraphs removed (was 10 pts after each paragraph, now 0)

## v.15
* Unknown Date
* Space between lines removed (went from Word’s default 1.15 line spacing to single spaced)

## v.18 - May 2, 2009 12:38 PM

## v.19
* Unknown Date
* “Stuff” was added to “Part 7” (now Part 1 Epilogue)
* “Stuff” was just the “Part 7” Questions in the review

## v.20 - May 2, 2009 8:32 PM
* Subheadings within Parts were made bigger (bumped from 12 to 14 font size to further distinguish them from the text)

* News was added (to the end of “Part 8” [now Part 2 Prologue])
* v.21 was reconstructed after being erased as told by the dates

## v.22 - May 3, 2009 4:35 PM
* Parts were put on separate webpages

## v.23 - May 3, 2009 4:35 PM
