This page details the updates to [Lucario and Lickilicky's Adventure (Yellow Version)](/story/version/lucario-adventure-yellow.html).

**Note:** Back when I was working on the story, I treated changes and additional chapters like I was updating a program, using version numbering. 
Fortunately, it was a single number (no minor versions / patch numbers). Unfortunately, this version was more aggressive with upping the version 
number (though for a much shorter timeframe).
