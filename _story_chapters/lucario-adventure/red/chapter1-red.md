Here on the pokemon planet, most of the inhabitants just call it Pokemon, everyone is a pokemon. Unlike Earth, there are no humans, no animals, just pokemon. My friend Lucario is very rich and very old. 
He owns a huge mansion with many butlers and many rooms. I am his friend Lickilicky. I will tell you the story of our great adventure.

#### October 5, 2012
One day, Lucario woke up anxious. Mudkip, Houndoom, Sceptile, and I entered the room.

“Bored you look,” Houndoom said. [He talks like Yoda].

“Oh, I’m just bored of doing the same thing everyday,” Lucario said.

“Why?” Sceptile asked. [He usually just asks single word questions].

“Why wouldn’t I?” Lucario asked.

“Do you want to go on an adventure?” Mudkip asked, without giving time for an answer. [Mudkip talks like Max].

“Yes,” Lucario said. “Lickilicky, call Blissey to watch my kids for me.”

I called Blissey’s number [242]. The phone didn’t ring.

“Hello,” a voice said.

“Oh, hi Happiny,” I said. “Can I speak to your mom?” [I talk like Professor Rowan].

“Okay,” Happiny said handing the phone to Blissey.

“Hi,” I said.

“Hubakunychanikad,” Blissey said.

“Is that some way of saying hi in another language?” I asked.

“No, it’s just… never mind,” Blissey said.

“Okay, can you watch Lucario’s kids today until we come back?” I asked.

“Okay, I’ll be over ASAP,” Blissey said.

Lucario and Houndoom were having their own conversation as Blissey and I were.

“Ha, I win!” Lucario yelled.

“Won I clearly did,” Houndoom argued.

“Okay guys, just say both of you won,” I said.

“Fine,” Lucario and Houndoom said at the same time.

We all got in their spaceship. We went towards Earth. On the way we hit a meteor.

“Oh no,” I said.

“Is it what?” Houndoom asked.

“Speak English, Houndoom,” I replied.

“Speaking English I am,” Houndoom said.

“What did you say Oh no for?” Mudkip asked.

“Stay out of this!” I snapped.

“But I just…” Mudkip said.

“No, we don’t care what you have to say!” I said, interrupting Mudkip.

“For yourself speak,” Houndoom said.

“I wanted to…” Mudkip said.

“I said I don’t…” I said interrupting Mudkip again.

“Lickilicky, what did you say oh no for?” Lucario asked me, rudely interrupting me.

“Oh, the engine was damaged by the meteor that hit us,” I replied. “This means we will most likely crash into a planet, get split up, and die.”

“What?” Sceptile asked.

“Oh, that’s not too bad,” Mudkip said.

“How?” Sceptile asked.

“What? Are you kidding? That’s horrible!” I yelled.

“Who asked you?” Mudkip yelled.

“What planet will we hit?” Lucario asked.

“That one,” I replied pointing to a planet.

“That’s MapleFate!” Lucario yelled.

“How do you know?” I asked.

“Oh, I read the sign on the pole sticking out of the planet,” Lucario replied.

Suddenly, something came out of nowhere and hit our ship.

#### Meanwhile…
It was morning on the planet of Hocatate. Almost everyone refers to our planet as just Hocatate. On our planet, we only have one building, which takes up part of the planet. 
We only have several living beings on our planet. Oh look, here they are now!

#### October 5, 2012
“Hey, Louie, we have to leave soon,” Olimar informed, as he entered the room.

“Where are we going?” I asked.

“All of us are going back to the pikmin planet that Olimar discovered back when his ship crashed on it,” Orawil, the president of our company, answered, listening in on our 
conversation. “We need to go back there to get more treasure.”

“But I thought we had tons of money,” Wobres, the infamous Hocatate Scientist said, hearing our conversation.

“Well, if you really think that, try buying lunch with the company’s profit,” Hacep, the construction worker, said, holding out a tin can with some spare change in it.

“So, who all is going?” I asked.

“Everyone,” Orawil replied. “You, Olimar, Hacep, Yihso, Wobres, and I.”

“But the ship only has room for two,” I informed.

“That’s why we bought the new ship, with room for all of us,” Orawil responded.

We all got in the ship without any further argument.

“Look out, there’s another ship!” I yelled.

“Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,” everyone screamed as we plummeted down to a mysterious planet.
