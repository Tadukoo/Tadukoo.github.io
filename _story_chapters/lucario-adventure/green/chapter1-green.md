#### Part 1 -  Lickilicky’s Side

#### August 11, 2000
One day Lucario woke up anxious. I am his friend Lickilicky. Houndoom, Mudkip, and I [his friends that live with him] came in

“Bored you look,” Houndoom said. [He talks like Yoda].

“Oh, I’m just bored of doing the same thing everyday,” Lucario said.

“Do you want to go on an adventure?” Mudkip asked. [Mudkip talks similar to Max].

“Yes,” Lucario said. “Lickilicky call Blissey to watch my mansion for me.”

I called Blissey’s number [242]. The phone didn’t ring.

“Hello,” a voice said.

“Oh, hi Happiny,” I said. “Can I speak to your mom?” [I talk like Professor Rowan].

“Okay,” Happiny said handing the phone to Blissey.

“Hi,” I said.

“Hubakunychanikad,” Blissey said.

“Is that some way of saying hi in another language?” I asked.

“No, it’s just… never mind,” Blissey said.

“Okay, can you watch Lucario’s mansion and kids?” I said.

“Sure, when?” Blissey asked.

“Starting today,” I replied.

“Okay, I’ll be over ASAP,” Blissey said.

Lucario and Houndoom were having their own conversation as Blissey and I were.

“Ha, I win!” Lucario yelled.

“Won I clearly did,” Houndoom argued.

“Okay guys, just say both of you won,” I said.

“Fine,” Lucario and Houndoom said at the same time.

We all got in their spaceship. We went towards Earth. On the way we hit a meteor.

“Oh no,” I said.

“Is it what?” Houndoom asked.

“Speak English, Houndoom,” I replied.

“Speaking English I am,” Houndoom said.

“What did you say Oh no for?” Mudkip asked.

“Stay out of this!” I yelled.

“But I just…” Mudkip said.

“No, we don’t care what you have to say!” I said, interrupting Mudkip.

“For yourself speak,” Houndoom said.

“I wanted to…” Mudkip said.

“I said I don’t…” I said interrupting Mudkip again.

“Lickilicky, what did you say oh no for?” Lucario asked me, interrupting me.

“Oh, the engine was damaged by the meteor that hit us,” I replied. “This means we will most likely crash into a planet, get split up, and die.”

“Oh, that’s not too bad,” Mudkip said.

“What? Are you kidding? That’s horrible!” I yelled.

“Who asked you?” Mudkip yelled.

“What planet will we hit?” Lucario asked.

“That one,” I replied pointing to a planet.

“That’s MapleFate!” Lucario yelled.

“How do you know?” I asked.

“Oh, I read the sign on the pole sticking out of the planet,” Lucario replied.

We were spiraling down towards MapleFate. Suddenly a ship hit ours, knocking both of our ships into another planet. No one had time to check what planet it was. Everyone and their ships went flying all over the planet.

#### Part 2 - Olimar’s Side
One morning I woke up. I had some cocoa when Louie, Orawil, Wobres, Hacep, and Yihso came in. Orawil is the president, Wobres is a scientist, Hacep is a construction worker, and Yihso is the company’s pet dinosaur.

“What are you doing?” Louie asked.

“What do you think I’m doing?” I asked.

“Um…” Louie replied. “Eating pie?”

“Okay, Orawil, what is the next spot we have to go to?” I asked.

“To the pikmin planet to get more treasures,” Orawil replied.

We all got in the spaceship after a ton of arguing. We got hit by a star in outer space. We saw a ship spiraling down towards a planet called MapleFate. We thought that if they hit it, they might end up at the pikmin planet.

Both of the ships ended up crashing on a planet. All of us and all of the ships got spread around the planet.

#### Part 3 - Together - Lucario and Olimar’s Side
Lucario and Olimar fell in an area with some strange creatures in it. They both got knocked out when they landed. Lucario woke up. 

“ME I WIN!” Lucario yelled.

“You win what?” Olimar asked, waking up.

“What?” Lucario asked when he woke up.

“Never mind,” Olimar replied. “Let’s find out where we are and our ships. Hey look, it’s pikmin!”

“What? Where?” Lucario asked.

“Don’t you remember the pikmin?” Olimar asked.

“No,” Lucario replied.

“Oh, yeah, that was someone else,” Olimar said.

They went around everywhere with the pikmin. They found four pieces of their ships. They eventually ended up finding Lickilicky, Louie, Hacep, Houndoom, Orawil, Mudkip, Wobres, and Yihso.
