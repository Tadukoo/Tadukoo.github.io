“Who are you?” Lickilicky asked.

“ME?” the person replied. “I’m Captain Falcon. And who are you?”

“I’m Lickilicky, this is Olimar, that’s Louie, he’s Orawil, and he’s Wobres,” Lickilicky said pointing to them.

“Well, let’s fight!” Captain Falcon said. “You-”

“We know, we already went through this,” Lickilicky said.

“Oh, then let’s fight!” Captain Falcon said.

Suddenly two figures came out of nowhere.

“Pikachu!” the first yelled.

“Puff!” the other screamed.

“These are my pals, Pikachu and Jigglypuff,” Captain Falcon said.

“I choose Wobres and Lucario,” Lickilicky said touching the Lucario trophy.

“3…, 2…, 1…, go!” a mysterious voice said in the background.

So they started fighting. Pikachu hits Wobres with thunderbolt and he drops the gadget and falls down. He gets up quickly and runs towards the gadget. Pikachu does too. Pikachu gets it first. 
He aims it at Wobres, but Wobres ducks and the beam heads towards Lucario.

“Not again,” Lucario said sadly.

Suddenly the beam split in two, went around Lucario, and hit Jigglypuff and Lickilicky. Then Pikachu started firing randomly everywhere around him, and he hit Captain Falcon and Lucario. Wobres 
came out from behind him and turned a dial on the side of the gadget and Pikachu fired at Wobres. The beam was right in front of Wobres when it turned around and hit Pikachu. When Pikachu was 
falling down he hit the Kirby statue and it came to life. Kirby quickly swallowed Wobres and spit him out, then fired the gadget at Wobres, Olimar, Louie, and Orawil. Then Kirby touched the 
Fox, Ness, Captain Falcon, Jigglypuff, and Pikachu trophies. They all came to life and got mad.

“3…, 2…, 1…, go!” a mysterious voice yelled.
