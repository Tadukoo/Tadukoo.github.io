  Lucario and Lickilicky look for another way to leave.
---
Lucario and Lickilicky went over to where Olimar, Louie, Orawil, and Wobres’ heads got planted in the ground. They looked like weird pikmin to pick from the ground. Lucario picked Olimar’s from the 
ground. He came up as a sky blue pikmin with Olimar’s head. Then he picked Louie out of the ground. He looked like an orange pikmin with Louie’s head. Lucario picked Orawil and Wobres from the 
ground. Orawil looked like a black pikmin with Orawil’s head and Wobres looked like a pink pikmin with his head. [Wobres is a boy].

Suddenly two things fell from the sky and hit Lucario on the head.

“What are these?” Lucario asked.

“Those are mine!” Olimar yelled. They searched all day for a way to get home. They failed.

#### The Next Day
“Do you know a way for me to get home?” Lucario asked.

“I’ll tell you if we can come,” Olimar answered.

“Okay, you guys can come,” Lucario replied.

“Yes!” Olimar exclaimed. “You know the two things that hit you on the head yesterday?”

“Yes,” Lucario answered.

“Well … one of those things was a teleporter,” Olimar said. “We can use it to get home.”

“Why didn’t you use it yesterday?” Lucario asked.

“I forgot,” Olimar replied.

Suddenly a bright light appeared.

“I’m blind!” everyone except Olimar yelled.

“Wait, I see something,” Lucario said.

“We’re on Mars!” Lickilicky yelled.

“Olimar, I thought we were going to my planet,” Lucario said.

“Why didn’t you ever tell us about the teleporter?” Louie, Orawil, and Wobres asked.

“Whoah, There’s a ton of onions here!” Lickilicky said.

There was blue, red, purple, yellow, green, brown, black, white, orange, sky blue, and pink, twenty of each.
