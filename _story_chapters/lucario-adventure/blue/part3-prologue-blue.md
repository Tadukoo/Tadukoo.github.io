“So, where are we going?” Olimar asked.

“I don’t know,” Lucario replied.

“Let’s go to the teleporters.” So they all went to the teleporters.

“Let’s go to Kirby!” Lucario yelled. So they all went to Kirby.

“Hi,” a pink ball shaped thing said.

“Do we know you?” Lucario asked.

“Yeah, aren’t you Kirby?” Lickilicky asked.

“Yes I am Kirby but I don’t know you,” the pink ball answered. “How do you know me?”

“We saw you at SSB,” Olimar replied.

“What is SSB?” Kirby asked.

“Super Smash Bros.” a mysterious voice answered.

“How do you know that,” Olimar asked.

“I went there once,” the figure that walked up to them said.

“My name is Meta Knight.”
