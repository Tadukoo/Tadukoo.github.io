Suddenly the mysterious voice said, “Classic Mode. Lucario, Lickilicky, Olimar, Louie, Orawil, Wobres. 3…, 2…, 1…, go!”

“Who do we fight?” Lickilicky asked.

“I don’t know,” Lucario answered.

“Lucario team vs. Mario,” the mysterious voice said.

“What!?!”Lucario said. “Who is Mario?!?”

“I am!” a mysterious voice replied. Suddenly a person with a red hat came out of nowhere.

“I will beat you!” Mario yelled.

“No we will beat you!” Lucario and Lickilicky said at the same time.

“This is an HP battle!” Mario said. “I have 300 and so do all of you!”

Wobres took out his weapon, aimed it at Mario, and fired. It did 100 damage! Then Mario punched Lucario and it did 25 damage. Lucario charged up his aura sphere when a colorful 
ball appeared. He hit it, it disappeared, and he started glowing. He attacked and he floated up to the sky and used aura storm! It hit Mario and did 150 damage!

“Link and Samus!” Mario yelled. “Come here!”

Suddenly two figures came out of nowhere. One was wearing green clothes. The other was in an orange suit. Mario, Link, and Samus all attacked everyone. Lucario was the only one 
to dodge.
