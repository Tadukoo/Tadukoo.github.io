  Lucario and Lickilicky finally head home.
---
Suddenly one billion pikmin came out of the onions and started going away.

“Where are they going?” Lucario asked.

“Let’s follow them,” Olimar replied.

They followed the pikmin into a mysterious building.

“Where are we?” Olimar asked.

“Pikmin pik,” one of the pikmin said.

“What does that mean?” Olimar asked.

“They said this is a building with teleporters,” Lucario said. “That’s what the signs are for.”

Lucario walked past the signs. There was the sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and **POKEMON**.

“Let’s go here!” Lucario said pointing at the sign saying pokemon.

“Don’t you want to get your ship?” Olimar asked.

“We don’t know where it is, do we?” Lucario replied.

“Well, the other thing that hit you on the head was a ship locater. We can locate your ship,” Olimar replied. “Your ship is on the sun.”

“Okay,” Lucario said. “We’ll go to the sun.”

They went to the sun and teleported his ship to the Pokemon planet, and then came back to the teleporters. Then they all went to the Pokemon planet. They went to see Arceus, Lucario’s friend.

When Arceus noticed Lucario he said, “Lucario, I didn’t see you for two thousand seven hundred forty years!!!”

“I was stuck on Earth,” Lucario replied. “My ship fell apart.”

“Oh well, you could have called me!!!” Arceus said.

“I didn’t take my phone,” Lucario replied.

“You should have!!! Now I’m really mad!!! I’m tired of arguing!!!” Arceus said. “I’m not your friend anymore!!!”

“Okay,” Lucario replied.

Arceus started walking towards Lucario. Lucario started backing up then fell down.

“No!!!” Lickilicky yelled. Lickilicky walked over to Lucario.

“Uh,” Lucario said. “Lickilicky… take care of… ‘Cough’ my kids.”

“Lucario,” Lickilicky said crying. “No!!! What did you do Arceus?”

“I didn’t do anything. It was his time,” Arceus replied.

Olimar, Louie, Orawil, Wobres, and Lickilicky went to Lucario’s mansion. Blissey greeted them at the door.

“Hi, where’s Lucario?” Blissey asked. “And why are you all crying?”

“Lucario’s dead,” Lickilicky replied.

“What I’m so sorry,” Blissey said. “What do we tell Mew [Lucario’s wife]?”
