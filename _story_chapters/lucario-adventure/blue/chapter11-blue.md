“Since you’re new, you can have Meta Knight,” Kirby said.

“Okay, let’s go!” Meta Knight threw his sword at Kirby.

“That should finish him,” he said. Kirby dodged it.

“Okay, maybe not,” Meta Knight said. “What do I use now? Oh yeah, my backup sword.” He pulled a sword out of his pants. Meta Knight went up to Kirby and used his sword on him. Meta Knight 
got one, two, three, four, five, six, **seven, eight, nine, te…** oh, Kirby dodged finally. Kirby’s health is down to 55%. Kirby used ice to freeze Lucario, Olimar, and Wobres. Louie punched 
Kirby. Kirby fell down and lost his ice powers. Kirby’s health is now down to 50%. Lucario just got unfrozen. His health is 30%. Lucario went up to Kirby to punch him, but Kirby sucked him in 
and spit him out at Olimar. Olimar got unfrozen by that and his health is now 10%. Olimar is shining red now. Wobres just got unfrozen and his health is 50%. Wobres was about to use his gadget 
when Kirby sucked him up, swallowed him, and spit him out at Lucario. Lucario’s health is now 10% and he is glowing red. Wobres’ health is now 30%. Kirby now has Wobres’ gadget. Kirby launched 
it at Lickilicky and his health went from 100% to 0% and he exploded.

“YOU KILLED HIM!!!” Lucario yelled. “THAT MAKES ME MAD!!!”

Lucario’s eyes turned red and he grew ten times the size he was and hit Kirby. Kirby’s health went to 25% and Lucario’s went to 0% and he exploded. Wobres used his gadget on Kirby and his 
health went from 25% right down to 0% and he exploded.

Kirby came back and said, “The fight is over! You guys won!”

“Where’s Lucario!” Wobres said.

“I don’t know,” Kirby replied.

“Then I’m sending you and Meta Knight there,”

Wobres said. He launched his gadget at Kirby, then at Meta Knight. They both were hit.

#### Meanwhile…
“Where are we?” Lucario asked Lickilicky.

“I don’t know” He responded. Suddenly a bright circle of light shined near them.

“What is that?” Lickilicky asked.

“I don’t know,” Lucario replied.

Then Kirby could be seen in the light.

“It’s Kirby!” Lickilicky yelled.

The light split into two circles.

“Why is there another one?” Lucario asked Lickilicky.

“I don’t know,” he answered.

Meta Knight was seen in the second circle. They both fell out of the circles and the circles disappeared.
