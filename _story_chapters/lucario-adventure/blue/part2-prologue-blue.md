#### Three days later
“Can we go now?” Lucario asked.

“I’d have to ask Olimar, Louie, Orawil, and Wobres first,” Lickilicky replied. “Olimar, Louie, Orawil, Wobres, Where are you?”

“We’re here!” They all yelled.

“Are you guys ready to go somewhere?” Lickilicky asked.

“Sure, where do you want to go?” Olimar replied. “It’s not where I want to go,” Lickilicky answered. “It’s where Lucario wants to go.”

“But Lucario died, remember?” Olimar asked.

“I know, but his son, Riolu, evolved into a lucario and now is known as Lucario,” Lickilicky replied.

“Oh,” Olimar said.

Lucario walked into the room. “Hi,” he said. Everyone was staring at him [except Lickilicky].

“You look just like your dad,” Olimar, Louie, Orawil, and Wobres said together.

“So, where do you want to go?” Lickilicky asked.

“I don’t know,” Lucario answered. “What are my choices?”

“Well, in the other room there is a teleporter that leads to a place on Mars with a bunch of teleporters to other planets,” Lickilicky answered.

So they went through that teleporter and Lucario was looking through the teleporters at the names.

“Let’s see,” Lucario said. “The Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, Pokemon, SSB.”

“What’s SSB?” Lucario asked.

“I don’t know,” Everyone else replied.

“Let’s go!” Lucario yelled.

#### SSB
“Where are we?” Lucario asked.

“We’re on SSB,” Lickilicky said nervously.

“What does SSB stand for?” Lucario asked.

“Super Smash Bros.” a mysterious voice answered.

“And who are you?” Lucario questioned.

“Cough… I’m … cough… Fox… cough,” the mysterious voice replied. “Sorry, I have a cough.”

“What do you do here and why is it so dark?” Lucario asked.

“HA HA HA!” Fox yelled. “You fight.”

“What!?!” Lucario said.
