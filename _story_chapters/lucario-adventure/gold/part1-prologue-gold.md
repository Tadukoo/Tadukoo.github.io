#### Prologue: The Adventure Begins!

#### Introduction
It was a bright shiny day on the planet Pokemon. With many areas on the planet, the Tadukoo Region is the strangest. In it, there are no humans, and thus no pokeballs. Well, 
actually there are pokeballs, but they’re just used as weapons.

In this region, all the pokemon live in houses, since no people live in them. In one mansion lives a Lucario, and his friends Lickilicky, Houndoom, Mudkip, Sceptile, and I 
live with him. Also there are other people who live here, such as his son Lucario, his wife Mew, his son Diglet, his son Bonsly, his son Mime Jr., and his daughter Mime Jr. 
Also, some of the friends he picked up on his journey, such as Olimar, Louie, Orawil, Wobres, Hacep, and Yihso live with him. This is my journal of what happened.

#### April 10, 100,000 AD
Today was an exciting day. Little did I know it, but today we would get a really long recap of a story that happened many years ago. I got out of bed and walked into the 
living room [or at least one of the living rooms], and I noticed that everyone was in there, waiting for me.

“You finally made it,” Lucario remarked. “Lickilicky was just about to tell us the story of that time we went on that million day adventure.”

“Okay,” Lickilicky said. “Is everyone ready for me to start?”

“Ready we have been,” Houndoom said.

“Okay,” Lickilicky said. “I will now start the story of Lucario and Lickilicky’s Adventure.”

“I just happened to write the whole thing down in a little book,” Lickilicky continued. “I named it Lucario and Lickilicky’s Adventure Blue Version. But even though I 
wrote it down, I will tell the story from memory.”

#### The Story
*It was a bright, shiny day on April 9, 2043. I was really bored, so I went into Lucario’s bedroom. He had been lying on his bed, sleeping. When I went into his room, 
he woke up.*

*“You look bored. Why are you bored?” I asked, except when I asked it, I was talking fast, as you all know I do a lot.*

*“I wish I could go on an adventure,” he replied. “But if I leave my mansion, who will watch my kids for me?”*

*“What about Blissey?” I replied. “She’s good at watching anything.”*

*“Ugh,” Lucario groaned. “I’ll call her.”*

*He dialed her number, which was 242. I remember it like I was dead.*

*“Hi Lucario, why did you call?” Blissey asked, before Lucario even realized she had picked up.*

*The reason I know all of this conversation is because I was listening in on it.*

*“Hubakunychanikad,” Lucario answered her, not thinking at all, since he was confused.*

*I took the phone from him and said, “Hi Blissey, Lucario and I are going on an adventure. Can you watch Lucario’s kids for him? Thanks, bye” Of course, I was talking 
fast when I said that.*

*Then I pretended to hang up the phone.*

*Before I hung up for real, I heard Blissey say, “Ah! Same old Lickilicky. Nice boy.”*

*“Where do you want to go?” I asked Lucario.*

“A second wait,” Houndoom interrupted. “Many errors, you already have.”

“What errors?” Lickilicky asked.

“I’ll look at his version of the story, Lucario and Lickilicky’s Adventure Yellow Version, and tell you, since I hate the way he talks,” Olimar replied.

Houndoom gave him a glare.

“Let’s see… According to this, it happened on July 5, 2009, not April 9, 2043. And my version, Lucario and Lickilicky’s Adventure Green Version, says that it was 
August 11, 2000 and Sceptile’s version, Lucario and Lickilicky’s Adventure Red Version, says it was October 5, 2012,” Olimar said.

“I remember it happened that exact year,” Lickilicky remarked. “I should know, it was exactly two years after I was born.”

“Let me finish my side, and then you can retell it with your versions,” Lickilicky said. “Okay now, where was I? Oh yeah…”

*“I want to go to Earth.” Lucario replied. “I heard there were humans and other pokemon there.”*

*“I’ve always wanted to go to earth,” I screamed. “When will we leave?”*

*“In about ten minutes,” Lucario replied. “I have to get ready, and I suggest you do the same.”*

*Then I went into one of the bathrooms, and I packed everything I owned into a suitcase. Later, I would realize I wouldn’t use any of it.*

*Since Lucario hadn’t repaired the ship since the last adventure, I had to spend about two hours fixing it. It took Lucario about three hours after that to finally 
come out and be ready.*

*“Are you ready?” Lucario asked me.*

*“I’ve been ready, where have you been?” I questioned him.*

*“Did you fix the ship?” he asked, ignoring my question.*

*“Yes, it took two hours,” I said.*

*“Okay, let’s go,” Lucario said.*

*So we got in the ship, taking in everything we owned, or at least all the stuff in the two nearest rooms.*

*We finally lifted off after an hour of arguing, and the ship took forever to get into outer space.*

*Once we were in outer space, the ship was practically destroyed.*

*“Are you sure you fixed the ship right?” Lucario asked me.*

*“Yes, I did,” I replied. “But that doesn’t mean that the ship coming right towards us will help make it work right.”*

*“What ship?” Lucario asked.*

*“That one!” I yelled.*

*The ship was just about to hit us when…*

“I have to go to the bathroom!” Sceptile interrupted.

“Okay, that seems like a good stopping point for now,” Lickilicky said.
