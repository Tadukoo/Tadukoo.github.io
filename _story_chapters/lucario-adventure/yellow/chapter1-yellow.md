“Where are we? What happened?” Lucario asked.

“We’re still in orbit around this planet,” Lickilicky replied.

“Oh, I thought that was a dream,” Lucario said.

“So did we,” Lickilicky said. “Until we woke up.”

“What planet is it?” Lucario asked.

“It’s Earth!” Lickilicky responded.

“I’m calling Blissey,” Lucario said.

“Okay,” Lickilicky said.

Lucario dialed Blissey’s number. It went to the answering machine.

“Oh, duh,” Lucario said realizing that Blissey was at his house. Lucario dialed his house number [448].

Blissey answered, “Hi Lucario. Why did you call?”

“Hubakunychanikad,” Lucario said.

Lickilicky took the phone. “HiBlissey.We’reinorbitofearthrightnow.Lucariowantedtoknowhowyouweredoing,” Lickilicky said.

“I’m fine,” Blissey said when Lickilicky hung up. “Ah, same old weirdoes, nice people.”

“Crash on Earth or float in outer space we have more gas to,” Houndoom said. “Is it which?”

“To Earth it is!” Lucario yelled.

They turned the ship towards Earth, stepped on the gas, and they went spiraling down to it. **BOOM!** Their ship blew up into 150 pieces. Suddenly they saw a familiar looking ship spiraling 
down towards theirs. The other ship hit theirs and all of the people in that ship and theirs flew to the other side of the planet. 

“Where are we?” a mysterious voice asked.

“Who said that?” Lucario asked.

“I did,” a figure standing right in front of him replied.

“Olimar!” Lucario yelled.

“How do you know me?” the figure asked.

“I met you when I was fifty,” Lucario replied. “Did you get another upgrade on your suit yet?”

“Yes,” Olimar responded. “It lasts five million days now!”

“Whoah, that’s a lot!” Lucario yelled.

“How many parts did your ship blow up into this time?” Olimar asked.

“One hundred fifty,” Lucario answered looking at the radar on his watch. **BOOM!** “Make that one hundred fifty one. Yours has two.” **BOOM!**

“Make that three,” Olimar said.

“Wow! That’s really different from last time!” Lucario said.

“Let’s go get them!” Lucario said. “Where are Louie, Orawil, and Wobres?”

“I don’t know, but we’ll find them eventually, and I brought Hacep and Yihso this time!” Olimar said. “When we came, Hacep was holding Yihso’s leash.” 

“Let’s go find them!” Lucario said.
