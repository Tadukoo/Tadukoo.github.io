There is a Lucario. He lives in a mansion. He has a lot of butlers and maids. There are seven million rooms. One hundred are bedrooms, the rest you will find out later. 
You really will this time.

#### July 5, 2009
Lucario was lying in bed. His friends Lickilicky and Houndoom who live with him came in.

“Youlookbored.Whyareyoubored?” Lickilicky asked. [Lickilicky talks fast rarely.]

“Wow,” Lucario responded.

“Wow what?” Lickilicky asked.

“Oh, nothing,” Lucario replied. “It’s just I’m surprised you’re talking fast.”

“Go on an adventure do you want to?” Houndoom asked.

“Sure,” Lucario said. “Where to?”

“Earth, I wanted to go to,” Houndoom answered.

“Okay, I’ll call Blissey to watch my mansion and take care of my kids.” Lucario said.

Lucario dialed Blissey’s number [242]. Her phone didn’t ring at all.

“HI Blissey, this is Lucario. Can you watch my mansion for me?” Lucario said.

“Hubakunychanikad,” Blissey replied. “Yes I can.”

“Thank you. Bye,” Lucario said. He hung up.

“Ah, same old Lucario, nice boy,” Blissey said.

“I have to get ready in bathroom 448. Lickilicky, go get ready yourself in bathroom 150. Houndoom, you go get ready yourself in bathroom 151,” Lucario said. [They have 450 bathrooms.] They got ready and prepared the ship.

“Okay,” Lucario said. “Let’s go.”

They all got in the ship and left. They went out of their planet’s orbit and got sucked into another planet’s orbit.

“What planet is this?” Lucario asked.

“I think it’s Maple Story,” Lickilicky replied.

“How do you know that?” Lucario asked.

“I looked at the sign on the pole in the planet,” Licklicky replied.

“Oh,” Lucario replied. They got out of that planet’s orbit and flew away.

They were spiraling out of control from a meteor hitting their ship when a ship hit them.

“Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,” they all screamed. They got stuck in yet another planet’s orbit.
