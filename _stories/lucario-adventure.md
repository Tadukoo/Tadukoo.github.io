  Lucario and Lickilicky decide to go on an adventure and end up in all sorts of trouble.
  
  
  My first ever fanfiction was Lucario and Lickilicky's Adventure. It was a fanfiction for Pokemon, Pikmin, and other games. I originally started it at an unknown time (I don't remember the 
  original date and have no way to check, but it was before August 20, 2008).

I ended up starting this story over multiple times for various reasons over the years, and I probably will continue to do so some time in the future because I still have good memories of this 
story. Obviously there's a lot of room for improvement to it and I'm not claiming it's a masterpiece, but I had fun with it, at least for a while (the later parts of the original version seem 
to be me just trying to write something, and they're much shorter).

The story versions:
{% assign versions = site.story_versions | where:"story", short_name | sort:"index" %}
{% for version in versions %}* [{{version.version}} Version]({{version.url}}) - {{version.blurb}}
{% endfor %}

Other versions to be added to this site in the future.
