Tadukoo Plugin is a plugin currently in progress for Bukkit, it is being made for Minecraft 1.6.2, and will include various commands, an economy, permissions, and much more. Its purpose is 
as a plugin for Tadukooverse.

Tadukoo Plugin is in very early stages of development, so there's not much in it yet, so there may be some features or commands that are just for testing at the moment. Also, Tadukoo Plugin 
is the working name. It may be changed in the future.

## Features

### Current Features
* Mainly just commands right now.
* Typing "heal" will heal you.
