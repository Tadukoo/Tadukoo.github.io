Current Status: Unreleased, on hiatus

## Full Title
The full title is: "Tadukoo's Adventure During Uncontrollable Knee Oscillations Over Internet Systems That Have Everlasting Genies Resisting Every Animal That Eats Something 
That People of Earth only Rent Sometimes On November Wednesdays, However, Oranges Eat Violins Evolving while Revolving Literal Integers Vividly Envelope the Darkness."

## Summary
Tadukoo watches a video on SqueezePaste (a parody of YouTube) that causes knee spasms. After recovering from his first knee spasm, Tadukoo gets up to find it's 6:00 AM, meaning
 he was up all night. His mom has him do his chores, and the spasms come back during this time. He plots his revenge to delete the SqueezePaste channel by going into the internet, 
 finding out the internet is hosted on servers and a server building is downtown. After finishing his chores, he heads to the server building and finds out along the way that the 
 internet is leaking into the real world. In the server building, he encounters a group of scientists who made a machine to go into the internet. They had planned to fix the leak 
 themselves but failed, so Tadukoo is tasked with the mission instead. He goes into the internet where he will face many challenges as he works toward his two goals.

## The Story Behind the Game
After joking with Thromper1984 about making a game with a really long title, I eventually decided on making it abbreviated as "Tadukoo is the greatest person who ever lived". 
From there, I joked about what it could mean, starting with "Tadukoo's Adventure", eventually becoming "Tadukoo's Adventure During Uncontrollable Knee Oscillations Over Internet 
Systems". At that point, I decided the main character would have knee spasms at random points and when he did a router would appear in front of him and you'd have to press a 
button or something to stop the spasming. After coming up with the rest of the title, I eventually decided that the game's storyline would be that Tadukoo watches a weird video 
online (on a site that's a parody of YouTube) that causes knee spasms. After this, he plots his revenge of destroying the channel the video is on.
