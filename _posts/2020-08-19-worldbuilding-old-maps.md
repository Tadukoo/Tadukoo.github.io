Since this is the first post in the "Worldbuilding series", I'll be explaining a little bit about that now. Over the years, there have been a bunch of video games I've wanted to make. It ranges from 
typical RPGs, to Super Smash Bros. clones, to Pokemon-type games, to 1000 Blank White Cards, and more. I was more into the story of games (which is why I liked Super Smash Bros. Brawl's Subspace 
Emissary), so most of my games involve worldbuilding. The worldbuilding I did ranges from game to game, as some I wrote more story and others I drew more maps, etc.

A friend of mine and I got to talking about maps recently and how he had made a fantasy map for his own worldbuilding project in the past. I remembered that years ago, I was drawing my own map of 
a Pokemon based world (with fake Pokemon I had made up for it). Now this map went through a lot, because I was playing with it, and imagining the history happening with whatever toys I had at the 
time. So this map is old, beat up, faded, and has tape everywhere. Some of the tape is to keep it together (it's 6 pieces of notebook paper), some is to patch it up, and some is to tape more 
scraps of paper to change the map based on events that happened. Also I used both sides of this thing.

Back in the day, I had a lot of fake Pokemon drawn up for it, but I don't think I wrote down much (if any) of the story for that world. In terms of map size, it was definitely the biggest 
world project I had. Later worlds would involve entire universes, but the maps weren't as detailed. In January 2010, I had decided I hated Pokemon and ripped up most of the papers involved 
in this project, so there's a lot lost now from it. For the record, I'm back into Pokemon again, though nowhere near as strongly as before.

Anyway, I took some pictures of some of the maps from the projects I worked on, and I ended up making one side of the big map into a couple computer renders.

So here's the original picture of the map:

And then here's the first computer render I made, where I used the temperature color mapping for the land and made it look like it's on an old piece of paper (computer style instead of using the 
real paper):

Then I made one that's just blue for the water and the computer style old paper color for the land, still using the old piece of paper look overall:

I plan to also make a render that includes the island names and territories, but that's for another time. I do like how these two above turned out. I don't know if I'll do anything further than that 
or not, but I have some ideas.

Some things I don't know though:
- What is the UFO-like thing near the center on the original? My only guess is it was a portal that some legendary Pokemon came out of, but you see other portals that are drawn differently.
- What are the stickers for? Are they decorations, or did they actually mean something at some point?
