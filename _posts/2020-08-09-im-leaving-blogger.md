As of today, I'm officially leaving Blogger. I'm taking all my posts with me too. I've setup two websites for my future blogging and programming projects, and all my posts from here will be available on one of those 
websites moving forward.

The first website is my personal website, https://tadukoo.github.io - On it, I'll be posting about my personal projects as well as any random posts I feel like posting. Most of my posts from here will be moving to this 
site, as most of my posts were about personal projects and random posts. This website is early in development, but it will ultimately include many details about me and what I'm working on.

The other website is for my new open source GitHub organization I'm started called Tadukooverse. The website is https://tadukooverse.github.io - On it, I'll be posting about projects I'm working on for Tadukooverse, which 
will all be open source and free to use and modify however you want. This will also be where I post programming tutorials moving forward. If anyone joins me at Tadukooverse, they will be able to make posts there as well. 
So my Java Look & Feel Journey and Java Components & Layouts Tutorial posts will be available on that site.

Here's a list of all my posts from Blogger in chronological order with links to their new homes on my other websites:
