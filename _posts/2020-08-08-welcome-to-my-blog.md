Today I uploaded all of my old blogger posts to either this website or https://tadukooverse.github.io (my new open source organization's website). The posts moved to that website relate to projects 
that I plan to transfer to that organization soon (Tadukoo Util, Tadukoo Engine/Launcher, and Tadukoo Bible Project). 

The posts I've transferred here either don't deal with programming projects at all, or they deal with personal projects I have no current plans of transferring at the moment.

This site will maintain my own personal blog for me to make random posts if I want and post about personal projects, while the other website will host blog posts about tutorials and my open source 
projects that I'm doing over there.

Sometime soon, I'll shut down my blogger site and make a post that's copied over here too, just to make it clear where everything is now. I do plan on maintaining some sort of presence on both blogs, 
but I'm not sure how much that will be. Also, I'll likely be more focused on the other site at the moment since I'm still setting up a bunch of stuff for it currently.

Essentially, I plan to use the projects I make over at Tadukooverse to make personal projects over here, but the projects over there are a little too early in development at the moment.
