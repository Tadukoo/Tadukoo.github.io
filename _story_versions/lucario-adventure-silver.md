At this point in remaking the story, I started experimenting more with how I told it. This version was telling the story through the perspective of Riolu, Lucario's son. 
I doon't really know how that would've worked out, with the main story happening on a completely different planet, and the fact that Riolu becomes a main character in 
Part 2 of the story, but we'll never know now how it would've worked, since it was never finished (and what was done got lost, but it probably wasn't very far).
