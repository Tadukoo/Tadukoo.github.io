summary: >
  With LeafGreen version, I gave the characters human names and again framed it as a story within a story (I think). Apparently I had big plans for multiple books now, with 
  "The Hidden Truth" being book 1 in the series. This version was started on November 8, 2011. In-between Gold version and this version I had ideas of changing the story to 
  use normal names for the people and to somehow turn it into a Christian allegory. I have no idea where the single prologue of this compares with those ideas, but at some 
  point, those ideas dropped the allegory idea and turned into a Doctor Who idea (which I'll likely write about on the blog at some point at the least). Gold to LeafGreen 
  was a weird time for this story.
parts:
- Pikmin
part_blurbs:
- Part 1 involves Leon and Jacob going to the Pikmin Planet.
